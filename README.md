# SELF AND TEAM ASSESSMENT
We were a 2 member team. Thus, we had to put on many hats during the course of the project. Infact the numbers of hats we, both my project partner and I, had to put on increased towards the second half of the project due to COVID-19 situation and schools being closed :)

But we really rose upto the challenge and it bought out the best in us in terms of coordinating, giving creative space and utilizing each others strengths on the project. We never once had an issue of who would do what. 

- We both researched topics and collectively decided on the topic 
- While Prentiss took to setting up the GitHub, I worked in parallel to understand and explore the data
- While I worked on the ETL part of the data, Prentiss setup the AWS Postgres Database with tables
- Once I was done with ETL and also the querying code, he took over for Machine Learning
- While he was working on ML, I setup our slide structure and worked on our dashboards

We worked like a well oiled machinery with no conflicts. 

## Handling of problems and contributing to each others roles
- We consulted each other as and when we faced problems and got stuck
- When we were unable to find a resolution amongst ourseleves we would reach out to Soren or the TAs and also simultaneously research the web
- We together ensured that the ball kept rolling forward 
- We also  consulted with each other when shaping an idea or making some important decisions on the project such as the approach, analysis, observations
- My strength on the project has been my comfort and exeprience with technology ... coding comes easy to me. Whereas Prentiss' strength has been his experience with US (our dataset was US based) and his consulting background. We both complemeneted each other and also supported each other in gaining additional skills and knowhow

# COMMUNICATION
Given our personal commitmenets, both Prentiss and I have 5 year olds who are being home-schooled now :) , we were comfortable communicating via cell phone texts, emails, bi-weekly zoom meetings and slack. 
We made use of every possible communication channel available to us to collaborate and make our lives easier.

# PERSONAL CHALLENGE
COVID-19 situation. It put additional unanticipated personal burden on our time. I had to not only do office work, project work, but also home-school my young daughter, and take care of the house etc. As a single mother, each minute of my day is literally accounted for and anything additional unplanned such as the current situation puts huge strain on the very limited times resource.
I am glad we were in the second half of the project when this hit us. As part of my basic nature, I am a planner and always want to fast pace work with an assumption that we really don't know what will happen in future and we may not really have the time or luxury that we see today. With that mindset I had started this project on a fast pace so that the last week either becomes a luxury or a much needed buffer for us ... also since we were both parents with full time jobs. 
Because of this I earned the nickname 'Queen Leadfoot' on the project :)

# TIPS for any new cohorts
Would be to have clearly demarcated roles and responsibilities, with trust in each others capabilities, a broad level understanding of what is important to each team member as a personal outcome from the project, and an open mindest to help and ellevate each other
